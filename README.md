# bufferbloat
In this exercise we study the dynamics of TCP in home networks.
In a real network it’s hard to measure cwnd (because it’s private to the Server) and the buffer occupancy (because it’s private to the router). To make our measurement job easier, we are going to emulate the network in Mininet.
